<p className = "text-justify m4" >
  Keystone is ultimately a system in which stories are told. These stories are a 
  collaboration between the Game Master (GM) and players. The GM presents a world 
  in which the players  tell their story. This includes providing locations, 
  adventure hooks, and Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that the players can engage with. 
  The Keystone system tries to facilitate stories that ride on a knife's edge, with 
  fast paced and punishing combat as well as significant consequences for poor decisions 
  but a plethora of options and abilities both in and out of combat to triumph over obstacles. 
  At any moment disaster may strike or victory may be snatched from the jaws of defeat. </p>
